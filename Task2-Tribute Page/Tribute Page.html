        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking">Stephen William Hawking</a> (8 January 1942 - 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist,
            and author who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of
            Cambridge.Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge,
            widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.

            Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his
            university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In
            October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where, in March 1966, he obtained his
            PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology.

            Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems
            in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation,
            often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and
            following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in
            theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the
            general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds
            interpretation of quantum mechanics.
